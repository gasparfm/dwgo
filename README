Don't Want to Go Outside!! v0.3

My first dockapp, hope you like it!

All you have to do is:
	* ./configure
	* make
	* Copy dwgo.conf to:
		* ~/.dwgo.conf
		* ~/.dwgo/dwgo.conf
	* Edit this file:
		* AddStation:METAR CODE:Description, just like it is written in that file. You cat get station codes visiting:
		http://adds.aviationweather.gov/metars/stations.txt
	* Start the application
	* Enjoy!

There is still a lot of work to do, some more coding and documentation. If you want to collaborate, please e-mail me and I will post new changes.
